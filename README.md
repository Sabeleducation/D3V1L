zero responsibility for any misuse of this project, and condemn any use other
than education, and testing of very crafted environments.

The Features are:
- completely anonymous. No servers, no IPs are needed

- fully customizable

- easy to understand

and modifiable. Pls do not publish the tool as yours and mention that you have the basis of me if you modify the tool!

I hope you have a lot of fun analyzing and trying out this tool!
